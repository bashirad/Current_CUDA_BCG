	\brief Tests the instantiation of two populations.
	The two lines below causes the function to crash with a stack overflow.
	To fix it do: Right-click on Gattaca (the project) > Properties > Configuration Properties > Linker > System > Stack Reserve Size
	and set this number to 2000000.  This figure works but it likely various by platform, depending on hardware. 
	How big is Strategy? See https://www.embedded.fm/blog/2016/6/28/how-big-is-an-enum.
